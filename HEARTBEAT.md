## Quick Checklist
- Ensure server is running (npm start) and channels show as registered.
- Check scheduled jobs (scheduler.json) for failures or runaway repeats.
- If project_manager created duplicates, run project_list and verify data.
- If Telegram is quiet, confirm TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN exists and polling is running.
