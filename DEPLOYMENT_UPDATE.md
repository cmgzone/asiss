# Deployment Fix Complete

I have fixed the TypeScript error (`Parameter 'answers' implicitly has an 'any' type`) in `src/cli/wizard.ts` and pushed the changes to GitHub.

## Next Steps:

1.  **Redeploy** the latest commit on Coolify.
2.  The build should pass now.

**Locally:**
The server is running successfully at **http://localhost:3003**.
(Note: You have multiple `npm start` sessions running, which is why it's using port 3003. You may want to close the older terminals if they are not needed).
