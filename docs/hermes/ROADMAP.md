# Hermes Evolution — Phase Roadmap

> Controlled architectural evolution of the gitu/ASISS codebase into the Hermes
> architecture. Rule: introduce a new abstraction -> wrap the existing subsystem
> -> move one responsibility -> test -> move the next -> remove the old path.
> The system stays usable at every step; `src/agents/runner.ts` is not rewritten
> wholesale.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Deliverable | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Freeze baseline | `docs/hermes/BASELINE.md`, `AGENT_RUNNER_FLOW.md`, `SUBSYSTEM_INVENTORY.md`, `scripts/smoke-baseline.ts` | [x] |
| 1 | Canonical Task system | `src/core/task/` (types, state, events, store, engine) | [x] |
| 2 | TaskEngine ownership | AgentRunner creates/executes Tasks while internals keep working | [ ] |
| 3 | Event system | Task/Tool/Agent/Checkpoint/Test events on an internal bus | [ ] |
| 4 | ToolEngine | Extract tool dispatch from AgentRunner (`src/core/tools/`) | [ ] |
| 5 | PolicyEngine | ALLOW / ASK / DENY before tool execution | [ ] |
| 6 | ModelEngine | Capability/reliability/cost scoring instead of naive routing | [ ] |
| 7 | ContextEngine | Budgeted relevance-based context construction | [ ] |
| 8 | Repository intelligence | Symbol/file/test index for coding tasks | [ ] |
| 9 | ExecutionScheduler | Real parallelism: deps, priorities, timeouts, retries | [ ] |
| 10 | Swarm on TaskEngine | AgentSwarm -> child Tasks -> AgentEngine | [ ] |
| 11 | VerificationEngine | Typecheck/lint/test/build gates; never trust "the model said it's fixed" | [ ] |
| 12 | Checkpoint integration | Task-aware checkpoints; mutations attributable to tasks | [ ] |
| 13 | Unified memory | Episodic/Semantic/Procedural/Project/Working memory | [ ] |
| 14 | LearningEngine | Observation -> evaluation -> validation -> promotion | [ ] |
| 15 | Background worker migration | Background goals/projects become Tasks | [ ] |
| 16 | AgentEngine | Unified Agent abstraction (Architect/Researcher/Coder/...) | [ ] |
| 17 | Self-repair loop | UNDERSTAND -> ... -> LEARN autonomous coding loop | [ ] |
| 18 | TelemetryEngine | Why-is-Hermes-slow observability | [ ] |
| 19 | Automated evals | `evals/` suite + regression gates | [ ] |
| 20 | Advanced autonomy | Persistent projects, learned routing, A2A federation | [ ] |

## Current milestone

Phase 0 + Phase 1 are complete: the baseline is frozen (see BASELINE.md) and the
canonical Task model + TaskEngine live in `src/core/task/`, fully decoupled from
AgentRunner. Phase 2 is the first wiring step: AgentRunner (or a thin adapter)
creates a Task per mission/run while its existing internals keep executing.
